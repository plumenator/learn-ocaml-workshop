(** This is a simple bot which connects to a single channel on an IRC server,
    sends a greeting, and then watches for other nicks to join the channel. When
    someone joins, the bot sends a simple greeting.

    Not much effort has been made to validate the success of various commands.
    Similarly, no attention has been given to the idea of connecting to multiple
    channels.

    Most of the heavy lifting is done in the parser written using the Angstrom
    library in lib/parser.ml. *)
